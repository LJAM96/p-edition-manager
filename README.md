# Plex Edition Manager


Edition Manager is a powerful utility that enhances your Plex movie library by automatically generating and updating rich "Edition" metadata based on technical and content specifications of your movie files.

In Plex, there are two concepts of "version": "[Edition](https://support.plex.tv/articles/multiple-editions/)" and "[Version](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200381043-multi-version-movies/)", but their uses are quite different.
Edition Manager
Edition Manager is a powerful tool designed to enhance your Plex media library by leveraging the Edition feature to display rich, customizable metadata for your movies.

- **User-Friendly GUI**: Easy-to-use interface with progress tracking and status updates
- **Performance Optimized**: Utilizes caching, multi-threading, and batch processing
- **Backup & Restore**: Provides options to backup and restore metadata, ensuring you can always revert changes
- **Plex Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your Plex server, updating movie information directly in the Plex interface


This tool is perfect for movie enthusiasts who want more detailed information about their digital collection at a glance, right within their Plex interface. It turns your Plex server into a comprehensive movie database, enhancing your browsing and selection experience.

# Requirements
Python 3.0 or higher installed.
All required dependencies installed using 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Docker (GUI)
The GUI can run inside Docker as long as an X server is available on the host.

1. Build the image from the project root:
   ```
   docker build -t edition-manager-gui .
   ```
2. (Linux) Allow Docker to talk to your current display once per session:
   ```
   xhost +local:docker
   ```
3. Start the container, sharing the display socket plus the config/modules folders so edits persist:
   ```
   docker run --rm -it \
     -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
     -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
     -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
     -v $(pwd)/modules:/app/modules \
     edition-manager-gui
   ```

Tips:
- Wayland: set `-e QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland` and mount your Wayland socket (for example `-v $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY:/tmp/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` together with `-e WAYLAND_DISPLAY`).
- Windows/macOS: run an external X server (e.g. VcXsrv/XQuartz) and set `-e DISPLAY=host.docker.internal:0.0`.
- Add `--device /dev/dri` if you want Qt to use hardware acceleration on Linux hosts.
- Remove the temporary permission when finished via `xhost -local:docker`.

# User-Friendly Operations:

Simply run the [GUI](https://github.com/Entree3k/Edition-Manager/blob/main/Edition%20Manager%20GUI.md) version
```
python edition-manager-gui.py
```
or on Widnows, double-click on `edition-manager-gui.pyw`

## Command Line Usage

Edition Manager can be used via command line:

Add all selected Edition information
```
python edition-manager.py --all


```
Remove all Edition information
```
python edition-manager.py --reset



```
Easy backup of current Edition information
```
python edition-manager.py --backup


```
Easy restore of Edition information that was backed up
```
python edition-manager.py --restore

```

Edition Manager transforms your Plex library, offering a more informative and customizable viewing experience. Whether you're distinguishing between cut versions, highlighting technical specifications, or simply enriching your movie displays, this tool provides the means to curate your library exactly as you envision it.

## Configuration

Edit `config/config.ini` to customize your setup:

### Server Settings
- `address`: Your Plex server URL (e.g., http://localhost:32400)
- `token`: Your Plex authentication token
- `skip_libraries`: Semi-colon separated list of libraries to skip

### Module Settings
- `order`: Control which modules are used and in what order. Use semi-colon to separated list

### Language Settings
- `excluded_languages`: Languages to exclude from detection
- `skip_multiple_audio_tracks`: Skip language tag if multiple audio tracks exist

### Performance Settings
- `max_workers`: Number of concurrent threads (4-12 recommended)
- `batch_size`: Movies to process in each batch (10-30 recommended)
- `cache_ttl`: Time to live for cache entries in seconds

Since Edition Manager only processes libraries of movie type, specify libraries of movie type to skip when needed. There is no limit to the number of modules for writing editions, so you can choose and configure them according to your needs.


#### Requirements
- Python 3.0 or higher installed.
- Necessary third-party libraries installed using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Errors**:
   - Verify your Plex server is running
   - Check your server address and token in config.ini
   - Ensure your network allows connections to the Plex server

2. **No Metadata Appearing**:
   - Check which modules are enabled in settings
   - Verify file naming follows expected patterns
   - Check logs for specific errors with modules

3. **Performance Issues**:
   - Adjust max_workers in settings (lower for less powerful systems)
   - Reduce batch_size for better responsiveness
   - Use the clear-cache option if cached data becomes stale

4. **Language Module Issues**:
   - Ensure the audio track is named with the proper language
   - Use a program like [mkvtoolnix](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) to rename audio tracks
